Advent of Code 2024
Day 8: Resonant Collinearity
https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8

Part 1:
    Given a grid of characters, find the number of points that are collinear with another point of the same character,
    if the distance to one of the points is double the distance to the other point.
Part 2:
    Given a grid of characters, find the number of points that are collinear with another point of the same character.
